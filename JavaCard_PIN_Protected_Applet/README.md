# Description

This project contains a Java Card applet that implements custom APDU commands for returning the developerâ€™s name, storing and retrieving data with length validation, and enforcing security through PIN verification. The applet includes error handling for incorrect CLA/INS values, wrong lengths, and secure access control for data operations, tested in both simulator and real smart card environments.
